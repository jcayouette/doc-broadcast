= Inventorying vCenter/vSphere ESXi Hosts with {susemgr}

== Introduction


Foreign virtual hosts (such as vCenter and vSphere ESXi) can be inventoried using the menu:Virtual Host Manager[]
.
From the vSphere Client you can define roles and permissions for vCenter and vSphere ESXi users allowing vSphere objects and resources to be imported and inventoried by {susemgr}
.
Objects and resources are then displayed as foreign hosts on the {susemgr}menu:Systems[Virtual Systems]
 page.

The following sections will guide you through: 

* Requirements
* Overview of permissions and roles
* Adding vCenter and vSphere ESXi hosts to SUSE Manager


== Requirements


The following table displays the default API communication port and required access rights for inventorying objects and resources.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Ports / Permissions
| Description


|

443
|

Default port that SUSE Manager uses to access the ESXi API for obtaining infrastructure data

|

read-only
|

All vCenter/ESXi objects and resources that should be inventoried by the Virtual Host Manager should be at least assigned the _read-only_ role.
Mark objects and resources with _no-access_ to exclude them from the inventory.
|===

== Permissions and Roles Overview


The following section will guide you through assigning user permissions and roles in vCenter/ESXi.

A user is someone who has been authorized access to an ESXi host.
The Virtual Host Manager (located on the SUSE Manager server) will inventory ESXi data defined by assigned roles and permissions on a user account. 

For example: The user John has been assigned the _read-only_ access role to all servers and datacenters in his company with one exception.
Johns account has been assigned the _no-access_ role on the company's __Financial Database server __.
You decide to use Johns user account and add the ESXi host to SUSE Manager.
During the inventory the__
                Financial Database server__ will be excluded.

Keep user access roles in mind when planning to add ESXi hosts to SUSE manager.
It is important to understand that SUSE Manager will not inventory any objects or resources assigned with the no-access role on any user account.

.User Roles/Permissions
[TIP]
====
When planning to add new ESXi hosts to SUSE Manager, ask yourself the following question:

_Have users assigned to a host been provided with the required roles and
                    permissions for objects and resources that should be inventoried by SUSE
                    Manager?_

== Adding New Users and Assigning Roles


See the official vSphere documentation on adding new users and assigning roles.

== Inventorying vCenter/vSphere ESXi Hosts


The following procedure will guide you through inventorying a VSphere ESXi host with {susemgr}
.


. From the {susemgr}{webui} select menu:Systems[] and then menu:Virtual Host Managers[] from the left navigation bar. 
. From the upper right corner of the menu:Virtual Host Managers[] page select menu:Add VMware-based Virtual Host Manager[] .
. From the menu:Add a VMware-based Virtual Host Manager[] page fill the following fields with your ESXi host data:
** Label: Custom name for your Virtual Host Manager
** Hostname: FQDN or host IP address
** Port: Default ESXi API port
** Username: ESXi user
+

IMPORTANT: 
Remember that only objects and resources which match a users defined role will be inventoried.
Set the users role on objects and resources you want inventoried to _read-only_
** Password: ESXi users password

. Click the menu:Add Virtual Host Manager[] button.
. From the menu:Virtual Host Managers[] page select the newly added Virtual Host manager.
. From the Virtual Host Managers menu:Properties[] page select menu:Refresh data from this Virtual Host Manager.[]
+

IMPORTANT: 
If you do not refresh the data from a new Virtual Host Manager, host data will not be inventoried and therefore will not be displayed under menu:Systems[Virtual Systems]
. 
. View inventoried ESXi host objects and resources by selecting menu:Systems[Virtual Systems] .
