You can upgrade the underlying operating system and also migrate {susemgr}
server from one patch level to the other (SP migration) or from one version to the next.
This works for migrating {susemgr}
server 3.0 or version 3.1 to version {productnumber}
. 

For migrating from version 2.1 to 3.0, see <<_bp.chap.mgr.migration>>.

[[_bp.sp.migration.sp]]
== Service Pack Migration


SUSE Manager utilizes {sls}
 12 as its underlying operating system.
Therefore Service Pack migration (for example, from version 12 SP1 to 12 SP3) may be performed in the same way as a typical SLES migration. 

.Upgrading PostgreSQL to Version 9.6 before Migrating to SLES12 SP3
[WARNING]
====
Before migrating the underlying system to {sle}
12 SP3 you must upgrade PostgreSQL to version 9.6. 

The migration needs PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.6 installed in parallel and PostgreSQL 9.4 is only available in SLES 12 SP2.
For more information, see <<_sp.migration.postgresql>>. 
====

{suse}
offers a graphical and command line tool for upgrading to a new service pack.
Comprehensive documentation for executing service pack migration scenarios is located in the {sls}
documentation chapter https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/cha_update_sle.html. 

[[_sp.migration.postgresql]]
== Upgrading PostgreSQL to Version 9.6

.Migrating to SLES 12 SP3
[WARNING]
====
{susemgr}
Server 3.1 must _not_ be migrated to SLES 12 SP3 before upgrading PostgreSQL to version 9.6. 
====


The upgrade needs PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.6 installed in parallel.
PostgreSQL 9.4 is only available in SLES 12 SP2. 

Before starting the update, prepare an up-to-date backup of your database. 

On existing installations of {susemgr}
Server 3.1 you must run 

----
{prompt.root}
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate.sh
----


to migrate from PostgreSQL 9.4 to version 9.6.
During the upgrade your {susemgr}
Server will not be accessible. 

The upgrade will create a copy of the database under [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``
 and thus needs sufficient disk space to hold two copies (9.4 and 9.6) of the database.
Because it does a full copy of the database, it also needs considerable time depending on the size of the database and the IO speed of the storage system. 

If your system is short on disk space you can do an fast, in-place upgrade by running 

----
{prompt.root}
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate.sh fast
----


The fast upgrade usually only takes minutes and no additional disk space.
However, in case of failure you need to restore the database from a backup. 

For more information, see https://wiki.microfocus.com/index.php?title=SUSE_Manager/postgresql96. 

[[_update.suse.manager]]
== Updating {susemgr}


This section provides information on performing regular updates and running a [command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade`` on your postgresql database. 

.Procedure: Updating {susemgr}
. As the {rootuser} user stop Spacewalk services: 
+

----
spacewalk-service stop
----
. Apply latest patches with: 
+

----
zypper patch
----
. You will be informed if a new database schema was included in the latest patch. Ensure the database is started with: 
+

----
rcpostgresql start
----
. Perform the upgrade with: 
+

----
spacewalk-schema-upgrade
----
. Start Spacewalk services again with: 
+

----
spacewalk-service start
----
+

.Restart of Services and Applications
IMPORTANT: Services affected by a package update are not automatically restarted after an update.
You need to restart these services manually to avoid potential failures. 

You may use [command]``zypper ps`` to check for any applications which may be using old code.
Restart these applications. 


[[_bp.sp.migration.version]]
== Migrating {susemgr} version 3.0 to 3.1


The migration can either be done with the Online Migration tool ({yast}
) or with the Zypper command line tool. 

.Reduce Installation Size
[NOTE]
====
When performing the migration, {yast}
will install all recommended packages.
Especially in the case of custom minimal installations, this may increase the installation size of the system significantly. 

To change this default behavior and allow only required packages, adjust [path]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf``
 and set the following variable: 

----
solver.onlyRequires = true
installRecommends=false # or commented
----

This changes the behavior of all package operations, such as the installation of patches or new packages.

.Checking PostgreSQL Version
[WARNING]
====
Before migrating to SLES 12 SP3, check whether PostgreSQL is already updated to version 9.6.
For more information, see <<_sp.migration.postgresql>>. 
====


To perform the migration with {yast}
, use the menu:Online Migration[]
 tool: 

.Procedure: Migrating using {yast}
. If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to update, switch to a text console. Running the update from within a GNOME session is not recommended. This does not apply when being logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME). 
. Start in {yast}menu:System[Online Migration] ([command]``yast2 migration``). {yast} will show possible migration targets with detailed summaries. 
+ 
In case of trouble, resolve the following issues first: 
+
** If the menu:Online Migration[] is not available, install the [package]#yast2-migration# package and its dependencies. Restart {yast} , otherwise the newly installed module will not be shown in the control center. 
** If there are "`old`" online updates available for installation, the migration tool will warn and ask to install them now before starting the actual migration. It is recommended to install all updates before proceeding. 
. If more than one migration target is available for your system, select one from the list. In case you are still on {sls} 12 SP1 or SP2, SLES 12 will be upgraded to SP2 or SP3, while selecting menu:SUSE Manager Server 3.1[] as a migration target. 
+

.{yast}: Select the Migration Target [[_fig_migration_summary]]
image::yast_migration_target31.png[]
. Update the {susemgr} database schema ([command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade``). 
. Make sure {susemgr} is up and running ([command]``spacewalk-service start``). 


After finishing the migration procedure {susemgr}
 3.1 on {sls}
 12 (SP2 or) SP3 is available to be used.
