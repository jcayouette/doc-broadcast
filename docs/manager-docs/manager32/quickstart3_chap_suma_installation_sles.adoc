This chapter provides the required (kvm) settings for installation of {sls}
media as the base for {susemgr}
.
A kernel virtual machine (kvm) combined with Virtual Machine Manager ([command]``virt-manager``) will be used as a sandbox for this installation. 

== SLES KVM Requirements


Enter the following settings when creating a new virtual machine using [command]``virt-manager`` (replace [replaceable]``version`` with the actual version string):

== SLES KVM Settings


This section provides guidance on installation of {susemgr}
utilizing the full installation media with KVM and [command]``virt-manager``.
This section assumes you have previously setup an account with SCC and downloaded the SLES full installation media. 

.Procedure: Preparing for SLES Installation
. In [command]``virt-manager`` select menu:File[] then menu:New Virtual Machine[] . 
. Choose menu:Local install media (ISO image or CDROM).[]
. Ensure menu:Use ISO Image[] is selected then click menu:Browse[] and locate the full SLES image you downloaded from your SCC account. 
. Configure your machine with at least 4096 MB RAM and a minimum of 2 CPUs. 
. Create a storage device with a minimum of 234 GB storage space for the installation. During the partitioning setup of the SLES installation this disk should be partitioned into a 4 GB ``swap``, a 130 GB partition (or a dedicated virtual disk) for [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` (XFS), and an additional 50 GB partition (or a dedicated virtual disk) for [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/`` (XFS). The remaining storage space will be used by the operating system for the root partition. Select menu:Finish[] to begin the installation. 


Installation of {sls}
will begin.
For more information on completing an installation of {sls}
, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_quickstarts/data/sec_sle_installquick.html.
