== Included Topics


This section covers setup procedures of {susemgr}
.
You will perform the following procedures: 

* Initiate {susemgr} setup from the command line 
* Create the [systemitem]``admin`` user with the {susemgr}{webui}
* Synchronize with {scc} (SCC) to obtain a list of product channels available for your clients. 
* Add the {sle} channel 


[[_suma.setup.with.yast.sumasetup]]
== {susemgr} Setup via GUI


This section will guide you through {susemgr}
setup procedures. 

.Procedure: {susemgr}Setup
. Log in to the {sle} desktop and start the {yast}{susemgr} Setup module: Either click menu:Applications[System Tools > YaST] and enter menu:SUSE Manager Setup[] , or open a terminal and as {rootuser} type [command]``yast2 susemanager_setup`` to initiate the setup. 
. On the initial screen select menu:Setup SUSE Manager from scratch[] and select menu:Next[] to continue. 
. Enter an email address which will receive notifications about the server's status. The number of emails sent from {susemgr} can be extensive, therefore notifications via email may be disabled from the {webui} after setup if desired. If wanted, enable advertising {susemgr} via SLP; this can simplify client setup. 
+ 
Select menu:Next[]
to continue. 
. Enter your certificate information and a password. The password should be stored in a secure location. _Without this password it will not be possible to set up a {susemgr} Proxy Server._ Select menu:Next[] to continue. 
+

. In menu:Database Settings[] , enter a database user and password. This password should be stored in a secure location. Select menu:Next[] to continue. 
+
image::quickstart-mgr-setup5.png[]
. {susemgr} requires that you connect to {scc} for software, updates and patches. You will not be able to synchronize or provide channels to your clients without this information. Enter your {scc}[systemitem]``Organization Credentials`` . You may open https://scc.suse.com/login to register or access to your organization credentials. Select [systemitem]``Next`` to continue. 
+
image::quickstart-mgr-setup6.png[]
. Select menu:Yes[] to run setup when prompted. When completed select [systemitem]``Next`` to continue. 
+ 
You will be presented with your new {susemgr}{webui}
address. 
+ 
Select menu:Finish[]
to complete {susemgr}
setup. 


In <<_suma.setup.with.yast.admin>>, you will create the administrator's account and synchronize with {scc}
. 

[[_suma.setup.with.yast.admin]]
== Creating the Organization with the Administrator's Account


This section will walk you through creating the organization with the administrator's account for your {susemgr}
Server.
The administrator's account is the highest authority account within {susemgr}
and therefore administrator account access information should be stored in a secure location.
It is recommended that an administrator creates low level user accounts designated for administration of each organization or group under the administrator's account for security. 
[[_suma.setup.admin.account]]
.Procedure: Setting up the Administrator's Account
. To begin open your browser and direct it to your {susemgr} Server URL which was provided to you after completing setup. 
+ 
Enter the menu:Organization Name[]
, then your menu:Desired Login[]
name and menu:Desired Password[]
.
Fill in the Account Information fields including an email for system notifications.
Select menu:Create Organization[]
to finish creating your administration account.

Congratulations! You should now be presented with the {susemgr}
Front Page. <<_quickstart.first.channel.sync>> will help prepare the server for connecting your first client. 

[[_quickstart.first.channel.sync]]
== Synchronizing with {scc} (SCC)

{scc}
(SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release and architecture.
You must synchronize your {susemgr}
Server with SCC to add channels for your client systems.
After synchronizing with SCC your clients are able to receive updates or be organized into groups to be assigned to a specific software channel.
This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui}
and adding your first client channels. 
[[_proc.quickstart.first.channel.sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. From the {susemgr}{webui} start page select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] . 
. From the menu:Setup Wizard[] page select the menu:SUSE Products[] tab. Wait a moment for the menu:Available Products Below[] list to populate. You are present with a list of repositories provided from SCC. Each of these repositories represents a single software source known as a [systemitem]``Base Channel`` within {susemgr} . You can also see the architecture, channels, and status information from this page. 
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[]
. As you are adding a {sle} client based on the [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture, scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. 
** Add single channels to {susemgr} by selecting the check box to the left the menu:+[] button of each channel. 
** Add multiple channels by selecting the check boxes to the left of the channels list and then schedule synchronization by clicking the [command]``\+ Add products`` button located at the bottom of the page. 


After adding your first channel {susemgr}
will schedule the channel to be copied and begin mirroring it.
This can take a long time as {susemgr}
must copy all software sources from the {suse}
Vendor repositories located at {scc}
to your servers local [replaceable]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory. 

.PostgreSQL and Transparant Huge Pages
[TIP]
====
In some environments, Transparent Huge Pages provided by the kernel may slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly. 

To disable transparant huge pages set the `transparent_hugepage` kernel parameter to ``never``.
This has to be changed in [path]``/etc/default/grub``
 and added to the line ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT``, for example: 

----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=noop transparent_hugepage=never"
----

To write the new configuration run [command]``grub2-mkconfig -o
     /boot/grub2/grub.cfg``.
To update the grub2 during boot run [command]``grub2-install
     /dev/sda``. 
====


Monitor channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the directory [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync``
: 

----
{prompt.root}
cd /var/log/rhn/reposync{prompt.root}
tail -f`CHANNEL_NAME`
.log
----


After your channel sync has completed proceed to <<_preparing.and.registering.clients>>.
